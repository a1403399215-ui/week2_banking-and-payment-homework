Question 1. Not secure means the connection between myself and the website is unencrypted or the security certification has a severe problem, which causes the information easily thefted or modified by others.
There are several risks when visit the websites with the warning pose,including information theft, hacker attack, virus affection and phishing
Question 2: Because the website uses https protocol, and the security certification doesn't have problems.
Question 3: There are some other ways to detect a phishing or scam sit, including checking the website carefully and finding https protocol and security locked sign.
There are some available online tools to check, including virustotal, phishtank, scamadviser and openphish.
Question 4: Typosquatting means using wrong spelling to hijack the offical website users. The first picture has an extra k at the word of bank and the second picture has a wrong suffix.
UDRP means Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy, it is used to handle domain-name dispute problems. This policy allows trademark owners to reclaim domain names from bad-faith registers.
I could monitor those phishing domains with wrong spelling, different suffix, sub domains, mixed number or character and homographs.
